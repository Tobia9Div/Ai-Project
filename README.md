# 🤖 Robot Maze Pathfinding Solver
Course: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Level 3)
This project implements and compares various search algorithms to find the optimal path for a robot in a grid-based maze with obstacles.

# 🚀📋 Project Description
The goal is to navigate a robot from a Start Point (Green) to a Goal Point (Red). The project evaluates the efficiency of different AI search strategies based on time complexity, nodes explored, and path optimality.

## Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms are implemented to solve the maze problem:

* Uninformed Search:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Guarantees the shortest path in a uniform cost grid.

* Informed Search:

*A Search:** Uses Manhattan Distance heuristic to find the optimal path efficiently.

📊 Performance Comparison
Based on our implementation, here is a summary of how the algorithms performed on a 5x5 maze:

BFS takes a longer time because it visit more nodes 
in the other hand the A* algorithm takes less time because it take the best path from the start point to the goal
## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
Requirements: Python 3.x and Tkinter library (pre-installed with Python).
